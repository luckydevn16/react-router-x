When using a `RouterProvider`, `useNavigate`/`useSubmit`/`fetcher.submit` are now stable across location changes, since we can handle relative routing via the `@remix-run/router` instance and get rid of our dependence on `useLocation()`. When using `BrowserRouter`, these hooks remain unstable across location changes because they still rely on `useLocation()`.
