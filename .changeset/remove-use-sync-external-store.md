Switched from `useSyncExternalStore` to `useState` for internal `@remix-run/router` router state syncing in `<RouterProvider>`. We found some [subtle bugs](https://codesandbox.io/s/use-sync-external-store-loop-9g7b81) where router state updates got propagated _before_ other normal `useState` updates, which could lead to footguns in `useEffect` calls.
